# FaceBlurer
Simple script built using Pillow and face_recognition** modules.

Enter the absolute path of a desired photo and in the nick of time you'll be asked for a path to save the edited photo. 
All the faces will be blured(or the ones AI could identify as faces at least)

**You need to have CMake C++ tools installed on you computer in order to use the face_recognition module.


Both pillow and face_recognition can be downloaded from thier repositories and a simple look through the documentation 
will arm you with everything you need to write a program like this with basic Pyhon knowledge.
